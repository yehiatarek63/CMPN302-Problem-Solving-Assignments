Given a 2D matrix of integers of size N*M, it is required to find the maximum number of cells that sum to 0 and do not have any duplicates. Solve this problem using a recursive brute force solution.

Note:

There is no specific set of movement directions for that problem, because any subset of cells is allowed. This is a simple include-exclude problem.

Input Format

one line containing N and M, space separated
the next N lines, each line contains M space separated numbers
Constraints

N is from 1 to 4
M is from 1 to 4
cell values are from -10^9 to 10^9
Output Format

one line containing the maximum number of cells that sum to 0 and do not have any duplicates
Sample Input 0

3 3
3 -3 4
2 2 0
7 -2 -2
Sample Output 0

5
Explanation 0

The cells are: 3, -3, 2, 0, -2. Note that we cannot add the other 2, -2 because the chosen cells will be containing duplicates.

Sample Input 1

2 3
-3 0 3 
2 1 0
Sample Output 1

4
Explanation 1

The cells: -3, 0, 2, 1. Note that -3, 0, 3 sum to zero but the length is 3 (less than 4). Note also that we cannot add the other 0 because of the duplicates condition.
