Given 5 numbers, find out if you can place the arithmetic operators {+, −, ∗} between them to create an arithmetic expression yielding to the value 27. Note that you can arrange the number in any arrangement(Hint: use next_permutation) so if the numbers given are 1 2 3 4 5 you can place the operators 1 + 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 or 5 * 2 + 3 - 1 * 4 also consider the +, -, * have the same precedence so just consider the calculation in a sequential way. for example here 1 + 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 --> ((((1 + 2) + 3) * 4) - 5) so you will do the first addition and then the second, then the multiplication then the subtraction so don't consider the * to have higher precedence. Solve this problem using a recursive brute force solution.
